# Javascript File Download

Javascript function to trigger browser to save data to file as if it was downloaded.

**Looking for maintainer:** I have been too busy with other open source projects to give enough attention to this one. However, I know many developers, myself included, are still relying on it to get their daily job done. I'll love to have someone take over this project from me. Please tweet or DM me @kennethj2007 if you are interested. Thank you!

# Installation

    npm install js-file-download --save

# Usage

    var fileDownload = require('js-file-download');
    fileDownload(data, 'filename.csv');
